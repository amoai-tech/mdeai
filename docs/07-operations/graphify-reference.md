# Graphify Reference — mdeai

Knowledge graph tool for codebase + docs analysis. Builds a queryable graph of every function, component, file, and document and the connections between them.

**Package:** `graphifyy` 0.8.36
**Venv:** `~/.venvs/graphify`
**Output:** `graphify-out/` (gitignored)
**Builder:** `scripts/graphify-run.sh` (thin wrapper over the `graphify` CLI)
**Current baseline:** [`docs/ai-second-brain/GRAPHIFY-BASELINE.md`](../_archive/legacy-active-docs-2026-09-18/task-130/ai-second-brain/GRAPHIFY-BASELINE.md)

## When to use graphify (and when not)

> **Graphify is keyword/label graph traversal, not semantic search.** It matches the
> exact identifiers extracted from the AST (function, component, file, and doc names) and
> walks the edges between them. It does not understand intent or paraphrase.

**Use graphify first when you know the exact shared symbol you're about to touch:**

```bash
# Good — anchor on an exact symbol name
npm run graphify:explain -- "conciergeAgent"          # locate + immediate neighbors
npm run graphify:explain -- "HostOpsCopilotBridge"
npm run graphify:explain -- "HostDashboardState"
npm run graphify:path -- "useConciergeCoAgent" "concierge.ts"   # how A connects to B
```

**Do not use graphify for vague natural-language discovery** — it keyword-matches and
returns noisy hits (e.g. doc nodes that merely contain the word "agent"):

```bash
# Bad — vague NL, returns noise
graphify query "where is the agent defined"
graphify query "what handles onboarding"
```

For fuzzy or conceptual discovery, use `grep` + `Read` instead. Reach for graphify once
you have an exact identifier to anchor on.

**Verified 2026-06-18:** `npm run graphify:explain -- "conciergeAgent"` resolves cleanly to
`src/mastra/agents/concierge.ts`; the vague NL query above returned unrelated doc nodes
(keyword-matched on "agent"). Exact symbol in → useful subgraph; vague sentence in → noise.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Activate the venv (required before every graphify command)
source ~/.venvs/graphify/bin/activate

# Run from the repository root
cd /home/sk/mdeai
```

---

## Commands

### path — shortest path between two things

```bash
npm run graphify:path -- "useConciergeCoAgent" "concierge.ts"
graphify path "createClient" "venue_booking_requests"
graphify path "CafeBrowseFilters" "buildFilterUrl"
```

Use actual function/file names from the graph, not conceptual names. If unsure of the exact name, search first:

```bash
# Find the real node name
python3 -c "
import json
with open('graphify-out/graph.json') as f:
    g = json.load(f)
hits = [n['label'] for n in g['nodes'] if 'copilot' in n['label'].lower()]
print(hits[:20])
"
```

### explain — plain-language description of a node

```bash
graphify explain "useRentalUi"
graphify explain "search-grounded-places.ts"
```

### query — BFS traversal for a question

Keyword-anchored BFS, not semantic. Works when the question contains an exact identifier
that exists in the graph; degrades to noise for paraphrased / conceptual questions (see
"When to use graphify" above).

```bash
graphify query "what calls createClient" --budget 3000
graphify query "Mastra tool registration" --dfs
```

### Blast radius — what depends on X

> There is **no `affected` command** (it is not in the `graphify` CLI nor in
> `scripts/graphify-run.sh`). Earlier docs that referenced `graphify affected …` were wrong.

To see what a change might break, use `explain` (lists a node's neighbors, including
importers) or `path` (how two symbols connect):

```bash
graphify explain "createClient"                       # neighbors + importers of the symbol
graphify path "useMapContext" "RentalsMapShell"       # is B reachable from A, and how
```

These return BFS **neighbors**, not a guaranteed-complete caller list. Before any breaking
change, confirm the full caller set with `grep` — the graph only captures static imports
(dynamic imports, `require()`, string lookups, and Next.js routing are invisible to it).

---

## Rebuild the Graph

Run the builder from the current repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/graphify-run.sh update .
```

This takes ~1 minute (AST-only, **$0, no LLM**). It:
1. Re-extracts changed code + docs via the `graphify` CLI (respecting `.graphifyignore`)
2. Runs clustering into communities
3. Writes `GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `manifest.json`, and `graph.json` into `graphify-out/`

Regenerate the HTML viz with `bash scripts/graphify-run.sh tree` → `graphify-out/GRAPH_TREE.html`.
Current measured node/edge/build-time numbers live in
[`docs/ai-second-brain/GRAPHIFY-BASELINE.md`](../_archive/legacy-active-docs-2026-09-18/task-130/ai-second-brain/GRAPHIFY-BASELINE.md).

**When to rebuild:**
- After significant new code (new features, major refactors)
- After adding or archiving planning docs
- Before running an architecture audit

**To rebuild code AST only** (faster, no doc re-extraction):

```bash
graphify update src/
```

## Corpus

### Phase 1 — Code only
| Source | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/` | 591 TS/TSX | AST extraction, zero LLM calls |

### Phase 2 — Code + Docs (current)
| Source | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/` | 591 TS/TSX | Reused from Phase 1 |
| `docs/` | 509 `.md` | PRDs, ARCHITECTURE, LESSONS, linear.md |
| `tasks/maps/` | 34 `.md` | MAP-001–012 specs |
| `tasks/mastra/` | 37 `.md` | Mastra task specs |
| `tasks/intelligence/` | 45 `.md` | Intelligence layer tasks |
| `tasks/real-estate/` | 31 `.md` | Rental/RE tasks |
| `tasks/events/` | 242 `.md` | Event tasks |
| `tasks/evidence/` | 121 `.md` | F-series evidence files |
| `tasks/partners/` | 45 `.md` | Partner tasks |

To change what is indexed, edit `.graphifyignore` (the include/exclude contract) — not a
script constant. Corpus counts above are historical Phase-1/2 figures; see
[`GRAPHIFY-BASELINE.md`](../_archive/legacy-active-docs-2026-09-18/task-130/ai-second-brain/GRAPHIFY-BASELINE.md) for the current measured corpus.

## Reading the Graph Report

`graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` is generated after every build.

**God nodes** — the most-connected symbols. Highest degree = everything depends on this.
- A code god node (e.g. `cn()`, `createClient()`) is a shared utility — expected.
- A doc god node (e.g. a PRD file with 100 edges) means many tasks reference it — expected.
- A god node in an unexpected place (e.g. `search-tool-renders.tsx` at 70 edges) signals hidden coupling worth investigating.

**Surprising connections** — edges the graph inferred across files that aren't explicit imports. Worth checking: sometimes they reveal real hidden coupling, sometimes they're AST noise.

**Import cycles** — circular dependencies. Zero is good. Any hit here needs immediate investigation.

**Communities** — groups of tightly connected nodes. Each community is a functional cluster. The top 40 are labeled by the LLM. The rest are "Community N" placeholders — not useless, just unnamed.

**Community cohesion score** — how tightly coupled the community is internally. Low (0.03) = loosely related files grouped together. High (0.8+) = everything imports everything else.

---

## Interpreting Results

### "No node matching X found"
The graph uses AST-extracted names, not conceptual names. Search for the actual identifier:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json
with open('graphify-out/graph.json') as f:
    g = json.load(f)
# Change 'copilot' to whatever you're looking for
hits = [(n['label'], n.get('source_file','')) for n in g['nodes']
        if 'copilot' in n['label'].lower()]
for lbl, sf in hits[:15]:
    print(f'{lbl}  ({sf})')
"
```

### Graph shows a file as isolated (dead code candidate)
Cross-check before acting. The graph only captures static imports. Dynamic imports, `require()`, string-based lookups, and Next.js page routing are not captured. A file with degree 0 might still be a live route.

### Community is just "Community N" with no label
The LLM only labeled the top 40 communities. To label more:
```bash
source ~/.venvs/graphify/bin/activate
python3 -c "
import json
from graphify.llm import label_communities
import networkx as nx
from networkx.readwrite import node_link_graph

with open('graphify-out/graph.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
G = node_link_graph(data)
communities = {}
for n, d in G.nodes(data=True):
    c = d.get('community', 0)
    communities.setdefault(c, []).append(n)

labels = label_communities(G, communities, backend='claude-cli', max_communities=100)
print(labels)
"
```

## Key Findings (Phase 2, 2026-06-09)

These are the audited findings. See the full report at `docs/graphify-audit-2026-06-09.md`.

| Finding | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| OpenClaw: 172 docs, zero code | **Done 2026-06-09** — archived to `/home/sk/mdeai/docs/_archive/openclaw/`; build script now skips `_archive/` dirs |
| Browse duplication: 4 functions in 5 files | Confirmed | Extract to `src/lib/browse/filter-utils.ts` |
| Commerce (`src/app/shop/`) | Live Phase 2 code | Keep — do not delete |
| `use-venue-booking-status.ts` queries `venue_booking_requests` with no user filter | **Cleared 2026-06-09** — RLS policy `venue_booking_select_own` enforces `user_id = auth.uid()` at DB level; no code change needed |
| `use-session.ts` calls Supabase directly | Safe | Auth-only calls, no data tables |
| `CONCIERGE_MODEL` etc. in `models.ts` | **Done 2026-06-09** — deleted 4 dead exports; `FLASH_MODEL` kept (9 importers) |
| `getSupabaseClient()` helpers | Historical Graphify snapshot only. Current `main` keeps per-tool Supabase helpers in Mastra search tools; verify current code before relying on this row. |

## Safeguards — What NOT to Do

These are hard rules learned during Phase 1/2 setup:

- **Do NOT run `graphify claude install`** — modifies CLAUDE.md automatically
- **Do NOT run `graphify hook install`** — modifies `.claude/settings.json` automatically
- **Do NOT run `graphify uninstall --purge`** — deletes `graphify-out/`
- **Do not include `tasks/design/`** in the corpus — it's 11 GB of images
- **Do not include `tasks/archive/` or `tasks/backup/`** — adds noise without value
- **`graphify update <path>`** only rebuilds code AST, skips docs — use the build script for full rebuilds
- **`_archive/` dirs are excluded** from doc extraction (build script filters `"_archive" not in f.parts`) — move obsolete docs there to clean the corpus without deleting them
- **Commerce `src/app/api/commerce/` routes ARE live** — the graph showed low connectivity for `src/lib/commerce/` but the routes exist and the shop page imports the client
