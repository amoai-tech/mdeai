# Merge approval history

Decision record for administrator overrides of the `main` approval requirement. `AGENTS.md` states
the operating rule; this file keeps the evidence for past exceptions so the rule itself does not
accumulate incident history.

Current rule: `main` requires one approving review. An administrator bypass is exceptional and must
be recorded in the affected PR — the reason, which required automated checks passed, and why waiting
for normal approval was not appropriate. See `AGENTS.md` § CI and merge approval.

## 2026-09-28 — PR #140 and PR #143

**Merged with an administrator override.**

**Why:** they were the upper layers of a stacked sequence, so the layer below blocked review of
everything above it. Every automated check that could run (`floor`, `deterministic chromium`,
`review`, `Vercel`) was already green, and neither PR touched runtime application code — they changed
skills, CI checks, and documentation.

**What the reviewer would have been asked to check:** whether the skill and gate changes were worth
landing at all, and whether the deferred finding in #140 should block the merge — eval packs with no
`expectations`, tracked as **SAN-1365**.

**Open question:** the second of those was never answered. The review thread was left unresolved
rather than closed, and SAN-1365 remains open.

**Not a precedent.** A production PR — anything changing application behaviour, a database, or a
deploy — satisfies the approval requirement normally. A bypass is defensible only for a non-runtime
change whose reason is written down here.

## 2026-09-29 — PR #150

**Merged with an administrator override.**

**Why:** the repository has exactly one collaborator — `amoai-tech` — which was also the PR author.
GitHub does not permit self-approval, so the required approval was not obtainable from any account.
The only alternatives were to leave a docs-only change unmergeable indefinitely, or to lower the
branch protection — which is worse, because it would remove the control for runtime PRs as well.
`floor`, `deterministic chromium`, `review`, `mastra-schema-init`, `Vercel`, Codacy and Kilo Code
Review were all green on the exact merged head `a6603616d`, and conversation resolution was satisfied
with 0 unresolved threads.

**What the reviewer would have been asked to check:** whether `mvp.md` states the right launch gates
and the right rental critical path (Build → Prove → Certify), and whether the three review rounds'
dispositions were correct — specifically the removal of volatile production status and the addition
of host payout to the Events gates.

**Nothing unreviewed rode along:** `mvp.md` was diffed against the reviewed head before merge and was
byte-identical, so the merged tree contains exactly what was reviewed. Merge commit `e1e33d4d7`.

**Open question — structural, not procedural:** a protected branch with a one-member review
requirement can never be satisfied, so every future PR faces the same choice. This should be fixed
deliberately — invite a second reviewer, or scope the review requirement so it excludes docs-only
paths — rather than worked around repeatedly.

**Not a precedent.** A production PR — anything changing application behaviour, a database, or a
deploy — satisfies the approval requirement normally. A bypass is defensible only for a non-runtime
change whose reason is written down here.

## 2026-09-29 — PR #155

**Merged with an administrator override.**

**Why:** the same structural blocker as PR #150. The repository has exactly one collaborator —
`amoai-tech` — which was also the PR author, so GitHub did not permit the required approval from any
account. `floor` (4m28s), `deterministic chromium`, `deterministic Maps contracts`,
`mastra-schema-init`, `supabase-acl`, `review / review`, `review / verify-review-result`,
`Kilo Code Review` and `Vercel` were all green on the exact merged head `1b6580d2a`. The only failing
check was `Codacy Static Code Analysis` (6 findings, all one false-positive class), which does not
gate a merge on this repository.

**What the reviewer would have been asked to check:** whether `floor` is the right owner for the
CopilotKit architecture contract, whether the deliberate alias indirection is preferable to inlining
the command, and whether running the guard at step 4 rather than later in the chain is the correct
fail-fast position.

**Nothing unreviewed rode along:** the merged tree was diffed against the reviewed head and is
byte-identical. Two files, `+157/-2`: `package.json` and
`scripts/__tests__/copilotkit-v2-guard.test.mjs`. Merge commit `88cc3c3e9`.

**Two review bots did not actually review this head, and their green status should not be read as
coverage.** CodeRabbit reported `pass` while its own comment says "Review limit reached"; Sourcery
reported `skipping` because the 250,000-character weekly diff budget was exhausted.

**Codacy disposition — 6 findings, all verified false positives.** Every finding was the same rule,
"The application dynamically constructs file or path information", on the new test's temp-root fixture
lines. No request, environment, CLI, or network input reaches those paths, so the heuristic's premise
does not hold for a hermetic test harness. This is a different class from the one catalogued in
`.claude/skills/code-review/references/ci-review.md`, which covers only the prose-absolute heuristic.
It is a candidate for that catalogue rather than a code change.

**Not a precedent — and now the second consecutive override.** PR #150 and PR #155 were both bypassed
for the same one-collaborator reason, which is the repetition this file's own open question from #150
warned against: *"a protected branch with a one-member review requirement can never be satisfied …
This should be fixed deliberately — invite a second reviewer, or scope the review requirement so it
excludes docs-only paths — rather than worked around repeatedly."* Two overrides in two merges is that
pattern. The structural fix remains open and is the reason a third entry should not be needed.

## Adding an entry

Record: the PRs, the date, the reason, which required checks had passed, what a reviewer would have
been asked, and any question left open. If an override becomes a habit, the rule is wrong and should
be changed deliberately — not worked around quietly.
