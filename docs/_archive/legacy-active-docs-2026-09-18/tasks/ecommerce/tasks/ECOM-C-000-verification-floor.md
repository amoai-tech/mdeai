# ECOM-C-000 - Repair mdeapp verification floor before commerce

## 1. Purpose

**Easy description:** Fix the mdeapp lint/typecheck verification floor so every later commerce PR has trustworthy proof.

**Goal:** Make the existing mdeapp verification floor trustworthy before adding Medusa commerce work.

**Why this exists:** This task keeps the commerce rollout executable by proving one bounded step toward the first milestone: AI product search -> ProductCard -> Medusa cart -> Stripe test checkout -> Medusa order.

## 2. Goals

- Ship this as one small PR.
- Preserve the existing mdeai Next.js/CopilotKit/Mastra app surface.
- Keep Medusa as the source of truth for mutable commerce data.
- Keep Supabase limited to identity, vectors, links, analytics, and pre-commerce records.
- Leave a rollback path and proof commands in the PR.

## 3. Features

- Patch `mdeapp/eslint.config.*` so lint ignores generated nested worktree/build artifacts such as `workspace/**`, `.worktrees/**`, and `**/.next/**`.
- Patch `mdeapp/tsconfig.json` or scoped TypeScript config so typecheck does not traverse generated nested worktree artifacts.
- Keep source lint/typecheck coverage for `mdeapp/src/**`, tests, scripts, and config.
- Re-run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run audit`.
- Do not add commerce features in this task.

## 4. Workflows

1. Run current floor commands.
2. Patch lint/typecheck scope for generated worktree artifacts.
3. Re-run lint, typecheck, test, and build.
4. Record remaining blockers in the task and audit docs.

### Files likely touched

- mdeapp/eslint.config.*
- workspace/**
- .worktrees/**
- **/.next/**
- mdeapp/tsconfig.json
- mdeapp/src/**
- npm run lint
- npm run typecheck
- npm test
- npm run build
- npm run audit

## 5. User Journeys

**Real-world example:** Sofia opens a commerce PR and can trust lint, typecheck, test, and build output instead of chasing generated artifact noise.

**Failure path:** If a dependency, SDK method, migration, or proof command fails, stop this task and update the task notes instead of widening scope.

## 6. Agents

- No autonomous agent behavior is added in this task; keep changes deterministic and manually verifiable.

## 7. Integrations

### Official docs/repos used

- https://docs.medusajs.com
- https://nextjs.org/docs
- https://typescript-eslint.io

### Skill guardrails

- `mde-task-lifecycle`: floor repair must be complete before implementation tasks start.
- `medusa`: do not begin Medusa service setup until existing app proof commands are trustworthy.

## 9. Definition of Done

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `npm run lint` no longer scans generated nested worktree artifacts.
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` completes without Node heap OOM.
- [ ] `npm test` remains green.
- [ ] `npm run build` remains green.
- [ ] Any remaining `npm run audit` findings are documented with severity and owner.

### Proof Commands

```bash
cd mdeapp && npm run lint
cd mdeapp && npm run typecheck
cd mdeapp && npm test
cd mdeapp && npm run build
cd mdeapp && npm run audit
```

### Rollback Plan

Revert the lint/TypeScript config changes and restore the previous verification behavior.

## 10. Tests

- Existing lint/typecheck/test/build/audit floor commands above are the tests for this task.
