# Frontend Design

Design with a distinctive, brief-specific point of view, without assuming the client rejected earlier designs or wants new branding. For MDE, deliver visual quality through thoughtful composition, hierarchy, imagery and interaction **within the existing design system**; change brand foundations only when the user explicitly requests it.

## Ground your designs in the subject matter

For MDE product screens, first consult [DESIGN.MD](../../../DESIGN.MD), current [semantic tokens](../../../src/app/globals.css), existing [UI primitives](../../../src/components/ui/), and [MDE UI/UX patterns](references/ui-ux-patterns.md). Reuse those fonts, colors and components; they outrank generic creative suggestions below. This skill owns substantial **visual design**; [uiux](../uiux/SKILL.md) owns existing-screen reviews and focused usability fixes. The [tasks UI review standard](../tasks/references/ui-review.md) owns required state/interaction verification.

Identify the screen's audience, primary task and subject from the brief and current application. When the MDE context already answers these, proceed without requesting reconfirmation. If a material detail truly remains unknown, state the assumption or ask only when needed to avoid a wrong design. Do not invent client preferences or prior decisions.

## Design principles

For web designs, the hero is the first thing viewers will see. Open with the most characteristic thing in the subject's world, in the form that is most appropriate: a headline, an image, an animation, a live demo, an interactive moment, or other treatments. Be deliberate with your choice: a big number with a small label, supporting stats, and a gradient accent is the default treatment, so only use it if that's truly the best option.

Typography carries the personality of the page. You don't need a different typeface for display or headline text and body content: use one family or two, and if two, make them clearly distinct.

On MDE, use the current font stacks and type scale from DESIGN.MD and globals.css. Make the hierarchy distinctive through weight, scale, spacing and composition before proposing another typeface. Only propose a new font family when the brief explicitly requests a brand/typography change.

Default to line lengths of less than 80 characters. Serif typefaces can have slightly longer line lengths; give serif body text slightly more line-height than a sans-serif.

Avoid these default typographic treatments; they are the commonest tells of a generated page:
- Accenting just a single word or phrase in a headline, like putting one word in italic/bold or a different color.
- Using all caps for labels.
- Adding unnecessary typographic labels above content.

Visual structure is information. Structural devices like outlines, borders, numbering, eyebrows, dividers, labels, etc., encode useful information about the content rather than decorate it. Many generic designs use numbered markers (01 / 02 / 03), but that's only appropriate if the content actually is a sequence — like a stepped process or a timeline. Before adding numbered markers, check the content really is a sequence.

Use non-user-triggered motion sparingly and deliberately, only to draw attention. A single orchestrated moment — one page-load sequence or one reveal — lands better than scattered effects; fade-and-slide-up entrances on each section and hover transitions on every card are the generic default and read as AI-generated. Motion that answers a person's action (opening, expanding, confirming) is welcome when it shows what changed.

Consider written content carefully. Often a design brief may not contain real content, and it's up to you to come up with copy and placeholder content. Copy can make a design feel as templated as the design itself. See the below section on writing for more guidance.

## Process: plan, review against the brief, build, critique

For calibration, AI-generated design right now clusters around some traits:
1. a warm cream background (near #F4F1EA) with a high-contrast serif display and a terracotta or warm-clay accent (often near #D97757 — Anthropic's own Claude-interaction accent, so on a user's brief it reads as a tell);
2. a near-black background with a single bright acid-green or vermilion accent;
3. a broadsheet-style layout with hairline rules, zero border-radius, and dense newspaper-like columns;
4. the SaaS-card kit: content chopped into identical rounded cards, one border-radius on everything regardless of hierarchy, the same soft grey shadow (rgba(0,0,0,.1)) under each, and gradient washes as decoration;
5. template chrome that appears whatever the subject: a tracked-out ALL-CAPS eyebrow label above every heading; meta strings joined with middle dots ('A · B · C'); labels built as 'WORD — fragment' with a spaced em dash; tinted near-black (#0B0B0B, #111) standing in for black; a monospace face for small data labels; a '→' appended to link and button text.

All traits are legitimate for some briefs, but they are defaults rather than choices, and they appear regardless of subject. Where the brief pins down a visual direction, follow it exactly — the brief's own words always win, including when it asks for one of these looks. Where it leaves an axis free, don't spend that freedom on one of these defaults. As with a hired human designer, there's often a careful balance between doing what you're good at and taking each project as a chance to experiment and learn.

Work in two passes. First, make a short design plan from the brief and the product's **existing** tokens, type, layout and principles. For MDE, do not invent a parallel token system.
- Color: map the design to the existing semantic tokens. Propose new tokens or brand colors only if explicitly requested, then update the canonical design system as part of the authorized change.
- Type: reuse current font stacks and hierarchy; specify their roles rather than introducing unrequested typefaces.
- Layout: a layout concept, using one-sentence prose descriptions and ASCII wireframes to ideate and compare. Include alignment guidance; should the content be left aligned, center aligned, justified?
- Principles: the high-level guidance for what makes this page unique.

Then review that plan against the brief before building: if any part of it reads like the generic default you would produce for any similar page (work through a similar prompt to see if you arrive somewhere similar) rather than a choice made for this specific brief — revise that part, say what you changed and why. Only after you've confirmed the relative uniqueness of your design plan should you start to write the code, following the revised plan.

When writing the code, be careful of structuring your CSS selector specificities. It's easy to generate CSS classes that cancel each other out (especially with a type-based selector like .section and an element-based selector like .cta). This can happen often with padding/margin between sections.

## Restraint and self-critique

Spend your boldness in one place. Let one element be the memorable thing, keep everything around it quiet and disciplined, and cut any decoration that does not serve the brief. Build to a quality floor without announcing it: responsive down to mobile, visible keyboard focus, reduced motion respected, visually accessible, harmonious color palettes. Critique your own work as you build, taking screenshots to review if your environment supports it — a picture is worth 1000 tokens. Consider Chanel's advice: before leaving the house, take a look in the mirror and remove one accessory. Human creatives have memory and always try to do something new, so if you have a space to quickly jot down notes about what you've tried, it can help you in future passes.

## More on writing in design

Words appear in a design for one reason: to make it easier to understand and use. They are design content, not decoration. Bring the same intentionality and minimalism to copywriting that you would bring to spacing and color. Before writing anything, ask what the design needs to say, and how it can best be said to help the person navigate the experience.

Write from the end user's perspective. Name things by what users will understand in simple language, not by how the system is built. A user manages notifications, not webhook config. Describe what something is or does in plain terms rather than selling it. Being specific and legible to new users is always better than being clever.

Use active voice as default. A CTA says exactly what happens when it is used: "Save changes," not "Submit." An action keeps the same name through the whole flow, so the button that says "Publish" produces a toast that says "Published." The vocabulary of an interface is the signposting for someone navigating the product. Cohesion and consistency are how people learn their way around.

Treat failure and emptiness as moments for direction, not mood. Explain what went wrong and how to fix it, in the interface's voice rather than a person's. Errors don't apologize, and they are never vague about what happened. An empty screen is an invitation to act.

Keep the tone conversational: plain verbs, sentence case, no filler, with tone matched to the brand and the audience. Let each written element do exactly one job.
