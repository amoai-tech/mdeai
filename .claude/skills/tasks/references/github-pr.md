# GitHub PR quality standard

The PR stage is part of the same Linear task. Use this after implementation checkpoints pass and before the task can approach Done.

## PR readiness

Before commit/opening a PR:

1. Re-read the Linear goal, scope, and Definition of Done.
2. Inspect the exact diff and changed-file list.
3. Run the pre-commit gate in [pre-commit.md](pre-commit.md).
4. Confirm every changed path belongs to this task.
5. Load the domain skills required by the changed paths.
6. Verify load-bearing external API assumptions with installed source/types and official sources.
7. Run the cheapest targeted proof for the actual change.
8. Run the risk-matched pre-merge matrix in [pre-merge-tests.md](pre-merge-tests.md).
9. Update Linear progress/evidence before commit.

## PR body

A reviewer should understand the change quickly. Include:

- user/business outcome
- faster/better implementation choice
- real user journey
- architecture/data-flow Mermaid when useful
- files changed and purpose
- source/reuse decisions
- auth/tenant/RLS/HITL impact when relevant
- external contracts/versions verified
- exact tests and results
- reviewer fast path: 3–5 files to inspect first
- explicit non-goals
- post-merge checks

## PR shape and exact-head rule

Keep the PR to one reviewable outcome. Split unrelated schema, infra, or second-task work before opening the PR. The body must link the exact Linear task and give reviewers a fast path to the 3–5 highest-risk files.

After any pushed fix, treat earlier green checks as stale evidence. Record the new head SHA and require the relevant checks/reviews on that exact head (or GitHub test-merge commit when the repository reports checks there). If branch protection requires the branch to be current with `main`, update it and rerun checks before merge.

Do not treat a skipped workflow as proof that the covered behavior was tested; verify that every task-required check actually ran.

## Automated-review freshness

Before merge, record whether each required reviewer/check evaluated the current head:

| Reviewer/check | Required? | Reviewed/tested SHA | Current? | Blocking findings |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| CodeRabbit | yes/no | `<SHA>` | yes/no | `<N>` |
| Qodo | yes/no | `<SHA>` | yes/no | `<N>` |
| CI | yes | `<SHA>` | yes/no | `<N>` |
| Preview | when applicable | `<SHA>` | yes/no | `<N>` |

A bot summary or approval on an older SHA is stale evidence after a push.

## PR troubleshooting rule

A review comment is a hypothesis, not authority. Follow the concrete re-check procedure in [`task-verifier/SKILL.md` § "Bot findings are hypotheses, not facts"](../../task-verifier/SKILL.md) — re-fetch the exact file(s) a bot names at the PR's current head before fixing or dismissing anything it reports; this file does not duplicate that procedure.

For every actionable comment:

```text
comment
→ classify
→ identify domain
→ load domain skill
→ inspect current code/version/live state
→ use MCP / official docs / official GitHub when needed
→ decide valid / invalid / stale / out-of-scope
→ smallest safe fix if valid
→ targeted verification
→ reply with evidence
→ resolve thread
```

Do not resolve because code was merely edited. Resolve only after proof is recorded.

## Completion gate

PR work is complete only when:

- all substantive comments are classified
- valid in-scope findings are fixed and verified
- invalid/stale/out-of-scope/noise findings are resolved with evidence or ownership
- exact-head CI is green
- no unresolved blocker thread remains
- post-merge checks are defined before merge

## Agent prompt

```text
Prepare or troubleshoot this PR as part of the same Linear task. Re-read the task goal/DoD, inspect the exact diff versus current base, run the pre-commit and pre-merge gates, and verify every changed file belongs to scope. Build a reviewer-friendly PR body with outcome, architecture/reuse decisions, security/tenant impact, exact verification, reviewer fast path, non-goals, and post-merge checks. Inventory every substantive review thread, classify each before editing, route uncertain claims through the owning skill/MCP/official source, apply the smallest verified fix, rerun targeted proof, reply with evidence, and resolve only after proof. Before acting on any bot-reported finding, follow task-verifier/SKILL.md's bot-recheck procedure: re-fetch the exact file at the current head and confirm the finding still holds. Do not merge until current-head required checks are green and no blocker remains.
```
