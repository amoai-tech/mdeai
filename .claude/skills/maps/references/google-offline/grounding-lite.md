Google Maps Platform Grounding Lite is a service with Model Context Protocol
(MCP) support that makes it easy to ground your AI applications with trusted
geospatial data from Google Maps. The MCP server provides tools that allow LLMs
to access capabilities for places, weather, and routes. You can try out
Maps Grounding Lite by enabling it in any tool that supports MCP servers.

## Tools

Maps Grounding Lite provides tools that allow LLMs to access the following
Google Maps capabilities:

- [**Search places**](https://developers.google.com/maps/ai/grounding-lite/reference/mcp/search_places): Request information about places and get AI-generated place data summaries, as well as Place IDs, latitude and longitude coordinates, and Google Maps links for each of the places included in the summary. You can use the returned Place IDs and latitude and longitude coordinates with other Google Maps Platform APIs to show places on a map.
- [**Lookup weather**](https://developers.google.com/maps/ai/grounding-lite/reference/mcp/lookup_weather): Request information about weather and return current conditions, hourly forecasts, and daily forecasts.
- [**Compute routes**](https://developers.google.com/maps/ai/grounding-lite/reference/mcp/compute_routes):
  Request information about driving or walking routes between two locations
  and return route distance and duration information.

  > [!NOTE]
  > **Note:** Maps Grounding Lite does not provide step-by-step routing, directions, real-time traffic, or navigation information.

Enabling the Maps Grounding Lite MCP server allows LLMs to call the new tools
exposed by the server to return additional grounding information for the data
types listed above. While the LLM can use this additional information for
context, the response that the LLM ultimately generates may not include the
exact information returned by the MCP server. You should verify the accuracy of
the generated response.

- The Google Maps sources must be viewable within one user interaction.

#### Sources for the Search places tool

The `search_places` tool `places` field provides sources that support the
`summary`. For `places`, the following metadata is returned:

- `place` (resource name)
- `id`
- `location`
- `googleMapsLinks`

For each place, you must generate a link preview that meets these requirements:

- Attribute each source to Google Maps, following the [Maps Grounding Lite
  text attribution guidelines](https://developers.google.com/maps/ai/grounding-lite/attribution).
- Link to the source using the `places.googleMapsLinks.placeUrl` from the response.

## Configure LLMs to use the MCP server

To use Maps Grounding Lite, you first need a Google Cloud project with
the *Maps Grounding Lite* API service enabled, as well as either an API
key or OAuth client ID. Then, you can configure LLMs to access the MCP
server. Grounding Lite MCP server uses Streamable HTTP transport.

### Enable the *Maps Grounding Lite* service on your Google Cloud project

To enable the API on your project:

1. In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/), choose the project you want to use for Maps Grounding Lite.
2. Enable billing for the project in the [Google Cloud
   Console](https://console.developers.google.com/billing/enable).

   Console API Library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/mapstools.googleapis.com).

### Authenticate using an API key

You can use an existing API key with Maps Grounding Lite or create a new
one, as long as you enable the [*Maps Grounding Lite* API
service](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/mapstools.googleapis.com)
on both the Google Cloud project and the key.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** For testing and prototyping, you can also use the [Maps Demo Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/demo-key) at no cost without setting up a billing account.

To authenticate using an API key:

1. Create or configure an API key by following the steps in [Getting started
   with Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started#api-key).
2. Pass the key to the MCP server using the `X-Goog-Api-Key` header. You need to specify this as a custom HTTP header in the LLM's MCP tool configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** When creating or configuring an API key, be sure to limit the use of the key by applying the appropriate restrictions. For more information, see [Restrict your API
> keys](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-security-best-practices#restricting-api-keys).

### Authenticate using OAuth

You can authenticate using OAuth by creating OAuth credentials and passing them
to the MCP host or MCP server application.

To authenticate using OAuth:

1. In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/), choose the project you want to use for Maps Grounding Lite.
2. In the *API \& Services* menu, select **Credentials**.
3. In the top menu, select **Create credentials \> OAuth client ID**.
4. If the project doesn't have a configured consent screen, click **Configure
   consent screen** and follow the on-screen instructions.
5. In the *Metrics* section, click **Create OAuth client**.
6. On the *Create OAuth client ID* screen, select an application type and enter a name for the client ID.
7. Specify the additional details that are relevant to your application type. For example, if you are creating a web application, add authorized URIs for browser and server requests.
8. Once your client is created, save the client ID and secret.
9. When configuring your MCP host or MCP server application to access Maps Grounding Lite, pass your OAuth client ID and secret. You must also request the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/maps-platform.mapstools`.

For more information, see [Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google
APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).

### Configure LLMs to access the Maps Grounding Lite MCP server

Once you have a Google Cloud project with the *Maps Grounding Lite API* service
enabled and valid credentials, such as an API key or OAuth client ID and
secret, you can configure LLMs to access the MCP server by following the
corresponding MCP configuration documentation and using the Maps Grounding Lite
MCP server URL: **https://mapstools.googleapis.com/mcp**

For more information, see [Configure MCP in an AI
application](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application).

#### Configure Maps Grounding Lite with the Gemini CLI

This section provides an example of how to configure the Maps Grounding
Lite MCP server using the [Gemini
CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). For more details, see
the [MCP servers with the Gemini
CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/tools/mcp-server.md).

1. Once you install the Gemini CLI, you can use the add command to configure
   the Maps Grounding Lite MCP server:

       gemini mcp add -s user -t http -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY' maps-grounding-lite-mcp https://mapstools.googleapis.com/mcp

   If the configuration was successful, you should see a confirmation that the
   server has been added to your user settings.
2. To validate that the server is working correctly, run the `/mcp list`
   command:

       > /mcp list

       Configured MCP servers:

       maps-grounding-lite-mcp - Ready (3 tools)
       Tools:
       -   compute_routes
       -   lookup_weather
       -   search_places

3. Start asking Maps related questions with the CLI. For example, try
   "Recommend me some restaurants in Mountain View" which should call the
   search_places tool on your behalf.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** For information on configuring a Gemini CLI extension to access Maps Grounding Lite using OAuth, see the [Gemini
> CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application#gemini-cli) section in the MCP on Google Cloud documentation.

#### Configure Grounding Lite with Agent Development Kit (ADK)

This section provides examples that show how to configure the Grounding Lite MCP
server using the [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://adk.dev/) and either
Python, Java, or TypeScript.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Ensure you have enabled the Maps Grounding Lite service and obtained an API key.

### Python

##### Step 1: Define your Agent with `McpToolset` for Google Maps Grounding Lite

Modify your `agent.py` file. Replace
`YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

```python
# ./adk_agent_samples/mcp_agent/agent.py
import os
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool import McpToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StreamableHTTPConnectionParams

# Retrieve the API key from an environment variable or directly insert it.
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = os.getenv("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY")
if not GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY:
    GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE"

if GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY == "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE":
    print("WARNING: GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY is not set.")

root_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-flash-latest',
    name='travel_planner_agent',
    description='A helpful assistant for planning travel routes.',
    tools=[
        McpToolset(
            connection_params=StreamableHTTPConnectionParams(
                url="https://mapstools.googleapis.com/mcp",
                headers={
                    "X-Goog-Api-Key": GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY,
                    "Content-Type": "application/json",
                    "Accept": "application/json, text/event-stream"
                }
            )
        )
    ]
)
    
```

##### Step 2: Ensure `__init__.py` Exists

Ensure you have an `__init__.py` in the same directory as your
`agent.py`:

```python
from . import agent
    
```

##### Step 3: Run `adk web` and Interact

1. **Set Environment Variable** :  
   Set your Google Maps API key as an environment variable in your terminal:

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
           
   ```
2. **Run `adk web`** :  
   Run the following command to start the ADK web interface:

   ```bash
   adk web
           
   ```
3. **Interact in the UI** :
   - Select the `travel_planner_agent`.
   - Try prompts like:
     - "I will be in San Francisco tomorrow. What's the weather like?"
     - "Find coffee shops near Golden Gate Park."
     - "Get directions from GooglePlex to SFO."

### Java

Define an agent that initializes the `McpToolset` in Java.
Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key
you obtained if you don't use an environment variable.

```java
package agents;

import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
import com.google.adk.runner.InMemoryRunner;
import com.google.adk.sessions.SessionKey;
import com.google.adk.tools.mcp.McpToolset;
import com.google.adk.tools.mcp.StreamableHttpServerParameters;
import com.google.genai.types.Content;
import com.google.genai.types.Part;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MapsAgentCreator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String googleMapsApiKey = System.getenv("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY");
        if (googleMapsApiKey == null || googleMapsApiKey.trim().isEmpty()) {
            googleMapsApiKey = "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE";
            if ("YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE".equals(googleMapsApiKey)) {
                System.out.println("WARNING: GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY is not set.");
            }
        }

        Map<String, String> headers = new HashMap<>();
        headers.put("X-Goog-Api-Key", googleMapsApiKey);
        headers.put("Content-Type", "application/json");
        headers.put("Accept", "application/json, text/event-stream");

        StreamableHttpServerParameters serverParams = StreamableHttpServerParameters.builder("https://mapstools.googleapis.com/mcp")
                .headers(headers)
                .build();

        try (McpToolset toolset = new McpToolset(serverParams)) {
            LlmAgent agent = LlmAgent.builder()
                    .model("gemini-flash-latest")
                    .name("travel_planner_agent")
                    .description("A helpful assistant for planning travel routes.")
                    .tools(toolset)
                    .build();

            System.out.println("Agent created: " + agent.name());

            InMemoryRunner runner = new InMemoryRunner(agent);
            String userId = "maps-user-" + System.currentTimeMillis();
            String sessionId = "maps-session-" + System.currentTimeMillis();
            String promptText = "Please give me directions to the nearest pharmacy to Madison Square Garden.";

            SessionKey sessionKey = runner.sessionService().createSession(runner.appName(), userId, null, sessionId).blockingGet().sessionKey();
            System.out.println("Session created: " + sessionId + " for user: " + userId);

            Content promptContent = Content.fromParts(Part.fromText(promptText));
            System.out.println("\nSending prompt: \"" + promptText + "\" to agent...\n");

            runner.runAsync(sessionKey, promptContent)
                    .blockingForEach(event -> {
                        System.out.println("Event received: " + event.toJson());
                    });
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
    
```

### TypeScript

Define an agent that initializes the `MCPToolset` in TypeScript:

```typescript
import 'dotenv/config';
import {LlmAgent, MCPToolset} from "@google/adk";

const googleMapsApiKey = process.env.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY;
if (!googleMapsApiKey) {
    console.warn("WARNING: GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY is not set.");
    throw new Error('GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY is not provided, please run "export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY" to add that.');
}

export const rootAgent = new LlmAgent({
    model: "gemini-flash-latest",
    name: "travel_planner_agent",
    description: "A helpful assistant for planning travel.",
    tools: [
        new MCPToolset({
            type: "SseConnectionParams",
            url: "https://mapstools.googleapis.com/mcp",
            headers: {
                "X-Goog-Api-Key": googleMapsApiKey,
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
                "Accept": "application/json, text/event-stream"
            }
        })
    ],
});
    
```
