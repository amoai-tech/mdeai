### Step 2: Use your Maps Demo Key with Google Maps Platform

The Maps Demo Key is technically an API key that supports a limited set of features. You
can use your Maps Demo Key in place of a standard API key in any of the
[supported Maps JavaScript API features or the Weather API](https://developers.google.com/maps/demo-key#supported-features).
The following example demonstrates using the Maps Demo Key with a basic map.
Replace `YOUR_DEMO_KEY` with the key you just retrieved.

```
<html>
<head>
  <title>Add a Map using HTML</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />
  <script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <gmp-map
    center="38.7946,-106.5348"
    zoom="4"
    map-id="DEMO_MAP_ID"
    style="height: 400px"
  >
  </gmp-map>
  <!--
    The `defer` attribute causes the script to execute after the full HTML
    document has been parsed. -->
  <script
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_DEMO_KEY&libraries=maps"
    defer
  ></script>
</body>
</html>
```
