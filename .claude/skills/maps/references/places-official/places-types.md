**Place types** are categories that identify the characteristics of a place.
A place can have one or more place types assigned to it.

A place's types are included in the **response** from a
Place Details (New),
Nearby Search (New), Text Search (New), and Autocomplete (New) request:

- A place can have a **single primary type** from type [Table A](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-types#table-a) or type [Table B](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-types#table-b) associated with it. For example, the **primary type** might be `mexican_restaurant` or `steak_house`.The **primary type** may be missing if the place's primary type is not a supported type. When a **primary type** is present, it is always one of the **types** in the `types` field.
- A place can have **multiple type values** from type [Table A](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-types#table-a) or type [Table B](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-types#table-b) associated with it. For example a restaurant might have the following **types** : `seafood_restaurant`, `restaurant`, `food`, `point_of_interest`, `establishment`.
- The address and address components of a place can be tagged with certain types from the [Address types and address component types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-types#address-types) table. For example, an address might be tagged as an `street_address` and a component of the address might be tagged as a `street_number`.

You can also specify place types as part of a **request**. When specified in the
request, the type acts as a filter to restrict the response to only include
places that match the specified types.

## About the type tables

[**Table A**](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-types#table-a) lists the supported values for place types:

- As part of a response from Place Details (New), Nearby Search (New), and Text Search (New). The values in Table A are then used to populate those fields.
- As part of a Nearby Search (New) request, used as the value of the `includedTypes`, `excludedTypes`, `includedPrimaryTypes`, and `excludedPrimaryTypes` parameter. The values in Table B are then used to populate those fields.
- As part of a Text Search (New) request, used as the value of the `includedType` parameter.
- As part of a Place Autocomplete Widget (New) request, use as the values to the `includedPrimaryTypes` parameter.
- As part of a Place Autocomplete Widget (New) response.

[**Table B**](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-types#table-b) lists additional place type values which
may also be returned as part of a Place Details (New),
Nearby Search (New),
Text Search (New), and
Place Autocomplete Widget (New) response. The request must specify at least
one of the `places.types` or `places.primaryType` fields in the field mask.
Values from Table B may NOT be used as part of a request, except as the values to the `includedPrimaryTypes` parameter
for a Place Autocomplete Widget (New) request.

[**Address types and address component types**](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-types#address-types) list types that may appear
in either or both address type and address component type arrays in the response
body. Address component types are subject to change.

### Table B

The Place type values in Table B may be returned as part of a Place Details (New),
Nearby Search (New),
Text Search (New), or
Autocomplete (New) response. These types are also supported
by `includedPrimaryTypes` for Autocomplete (New)
requests.

| Additional Place type values |||
|---|---|---|
| `administrative_area_level_3` `administrative_area_level_4` `administrative_area_level_5` `administrative_area_level_6` `administrative_area_level_7` `archipelago` `colloquial_area` `continent` `establishment` `finance` `food` `general_contractor` `geocode` `health` `intersection` `landmark` `natural_feature` `neighborhood` `place_of_worship` `plus_code` | `point_of_interest` `political` `postal_code_prefix` `postal_code_suffix` `postal_town` `premise` `route` `street_address` `sublocality` `sublocality_level_1` `sublocality_level_2` `sublocality_level_3` `sublocality_level_4` `sublocality_level_5` `subpremise` `town_square` |

### Address types and address component types

The `types` array in the response indicates the
*address type*. Examples of address types include a street address, a
country, or a political entity. The `types` array in
the `google.maps.places.AddressComponent` class indicates the type of each part of the
address. Examples include street number or country.

Addresses may have multiple types. The types may be considered 'tags'.
For example, many cities are tagged with the `political` and
`locality` types.

The following types are supported and returned in both the
address type and address component type arrays:

| Address Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `street_address` | A precise street address. |
| `route` | A named route (such as "US 101"). |
| `intersection` | A major intersection, usually of two major roads. |
| `political` | A political entity. Usually, this type indicates a polygon of some civil administration. |
| `country` | The national political entity, and is typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder. |
| `administrative_area_level_1` | A first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. In most cases, `administrative_area_level_1` short names will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a variety of signals and location data. |
| `administrative_area_level_2` | A second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_3` | A third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_4` | A fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_5` | A fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_6` | A sixth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_7` | A seventh-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `colloquial_area` | A commonly-used alternative name for the entity. |
| `locality` | An incorporated city or town political entity. |
| `sublocality` | A first-order civil entity below a locality. For some locations may receive one of the additional types: `sublocality_level_1` to `sublocality_level_5`. Each sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a smaller geographic area. |
| `neighborhood` | A named neighborhood. |
| `premise` | A named location, usually a building or collection of buildings with a common name. |
| `subpremise` | An addressable entity below the premise level, such as an apartment, unit, or suite. |
| `plus_code` | An encoded location reference, derived from latitude and longitude. Plus codes can be used as a replacement for street addresses in places where they do not exist (where buildings are not numbered or streets are not named). See <https://plus.codes> for details. |
| `postal_code` | A postal code as used to address postal mail within the country. |
| `natural_feature` | A prominent natural feature. |
| `airport` | An airport. |
| `park` | A named park. |
| `point_of_interest` | A named point of interest. Typically, these "POI"s are prominent local entities that don't easily fit in another category, such as "Empire State Building" or "Eiffel Tower". |

An empty list of types indicates there are no known types for the particular
address component (for example, Lieu-dit in France).

In addition to the above, address components may include the types listed below.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** This list is not exhaustive, and is subject to change.

| Address Component Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `floor` | The floor of a building address. |
| `establishment` | Typically a place that has not yet been categorized. |
| `landmark` | A nearby place that is used as a reference, to aid navigation. |
| `point_of_interest` | A named point of interest. |
| `parking` | A parking lot or parking structure. |
| `post_box` | A specific postal box. |
| `postal_town` | A grouping of geographic areas, such as `locality` and `sublocality`, used for mailing addresses in some countries. |
| `room` | The room of a building address. |
| `street_number` | The precise street number. |
| `bus_station`, `train_station` and `transit_station` | The location of a bus, train or public transit stop. |
