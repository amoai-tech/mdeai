# Mastra memory — docs & reference index

**mdeai Phase 1 concierge:** thread-scoped **working memory** (Zod in agent + `src/lib/types.ts`) only. Do **not** enable observational memory, semantic recall, or multi-user threads in production unless a task opens Phase 2.

**Lookup order:** [`mcp-docs-lookup.md`](mcp-docs-lookup.md) → **`mastraDocs`** paths below → [`links.md`](../links.md).
