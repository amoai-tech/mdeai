# Mastra workflows — docs & reference index

**mdeai Phase 1:** concierge uses **agents + tools** in-process; batch workflows (event discovery EVP-022) land W2+. **Roberto HITL** (W3–4) maps to **suspend/resume** + CopilotKit `renderAndWaitForResponse` — read both docs before wiring.

**Lookup order:** [`mcp-docs-lookup.md`](mcp-docs-lookup.md) → **`mastraDocs`** paths below → [`links.md`](../links.md).

| `.sleep()` | https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/workflow-methods/sleep | [suspend & resume § sleep](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/suspend-and-resume) |
| `.sleepUntil()` | https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/workflow-methods/sleepUntil | suspend & resume |

### Run methods (`reference/workflows/run-methods/`)

| Method | URL | Doc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.start()` | https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/run-methods/start | overview |
| `.startAsync()` | https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/run-methods/startAsync | overview |
| **`.resume()`** | https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/run-methods/resume | [suspend & resume](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/suspend-and-resume) |
| `.cancel()` | https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/run-methods/cancel | error handling |
| `.restart()` | https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/run-methods/restart | error handling |
| **`.timeTravel()`** | https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/run-methods/timeTravel | [time travel](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/time-travel) |

**Note:** There is **no** `reference/workflows/suspend-and-resume` page — suspend/resume is documented under `docs/workflows/suspend-and-resume` and implemented via step `suspend()` + run `.resume()`.
