/**
 * COST-001 — single source of truth for Gemini token pricing.
 *
 * No price literals anywhere else in the codebase. Rates are USD per 1M tokens
 * and intentionally conservative defaults; update here when Google changes
 * pricing. Unknown models fall back to the Flash rate and are flagged so a new
 * model never silently logs $0.
 *
 * Rates re-verified against the official page on 2026-09-26, which corrected
 * three stale entries that understated cost by roughly 3–5x. Rates are keyed by
 * the literal model id and must never be keyed by `GEMINI_FLASH_MODEL_ID`: a
 * price belongs to one specific model, so the table must not follow a constant
 * that is meant to be switched.
 *
 * @see https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing
